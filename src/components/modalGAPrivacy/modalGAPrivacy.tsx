        This Privacy Policy outlines the practices of Ref Protocol Foundation
        (Folio No. 25049150) (the "Company"), its related corporations, business
        units and affiliates, as well as their respective representatives and/or
        agents (collectively referred to herein as "we", "our", or "us")
        regarding the collection, use, disclosure and sharing of personal
        information when you visit our website https://www.ref.finance/ (the
        "Website"). We recognise our responsibilities in relation to the
        collection, holding, processing, use and/or transfer of personal data.
        Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. By using our website, you
        agree to the terms outlined in this policy. This Privacy Policy
        supplements but does not supersede nor replace any other consent which
        you may have previously provided to us nor does it affect any rights
        that we may have at law in connection with the collection, use and/or
        disclosure of your personal data. We may from time to time update this
        Privacy Policy to ensure that this Privacy Policy is consistent with our
        future developments, industry trends and/or any changes in legal or
        regulatory requirements. Subject to your rights at law, the prevailing
        terms of this Privacy Policy shall apply. When this Privacy Policy is
        updated, we will post a notice on the Website and also change the "Last
        Updated" date indicated at the top. For the avoidance of doubt, this
        Privacy Policy forms part of the terms and conditions governing your
        relationship with us and should be read in conjunction with such terms
        and conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The security of your personal data is important to us. At each stage of
        data collection, use and disclosure, we have in place physical,
        electronic, administrative and procedural safeguards to protect the
        personal data stored with us. However, do note that no transmission of
        personal data over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure –
        accordingly and despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee or warrant the
        security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online
        services. We shall not have any responsibility or liability for the
        security of information transmitted via the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how we may collect, use, disclose, process
        and manage your personal data, and applies to any individual’s personal
        data which is in our possession or under our control.
      </p>
      <h2>Personal data</h2>
      <p>
        "Personal data" means data, whether true or not, about an individual who
        can be identified (i) from that data, or (ii) from that data and other
        information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access.
        Some examples of personal data that we may collect are:
      </p>
      <div>(a) information or details regarding digital assets held;</div>
      <div>
        (b) particulars of digital wallet addresses (including transactions
        performed by said digital wallet addresses), public cryptographic key
        relating to digital wallet addresses on distributed ledger networks
        and/or similar information;
      </div>
      <div>
        (c) information about your use of our services and Website, and specific
        user interactions with the Website such as features utilised, areas
        visited or clicked on, and time spent; and
      </div>
      <div>
        (d) personal opinions made known to us (e.g. feedback or responses to
        surveys).
      </div>
      <p>
        Personal data will be automatically collected when you interact with our
        services, access the Website, interact with other users of our services,
        sign up for any beta/testing services, open an email from us or fill in
        any form or survey, register a user account or update a user account
        that you registered with us, engage with us (whether through live chat,
        message, phone call, email, social media accounts, messaging platforms,
        attendance at in-person events, opting-in to receive our marketing
        messages, or subscribing to our mailing lists), or make a purchase from
        us.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the extent permitted by law, we may also obtain other information
        about you such as contact information, change of address or demographic
        information from commercially available sources.
      </p>
      <h2>Personal data and the Blockchain</h2>
      <p>
        Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology
        (DLT), is at the core of our business. Blockchains are decentralised and
        made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called
        "blocks". The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological,
        meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since
        the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several "nodes"
        which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person
        making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an
        operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no centralised
        place where it is located either. Accordingly, by design, a blockchain’s
        data cannot be changed or deleted and is said to be "immutable". This
        may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to
        erasure ("right to be forgotten"), or your rights to object or restrict
        processing of your personal data. Data on the blockchain cannot be
        erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to
        revoke certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to
        others, it is not deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual
        obligations to you (such as delivery of tokens or provision of other
        services) it will be necessary to collect certain personal data, such as
        your wallet address, onto the blockchain; this is done through a smart
        contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your
        wallet’s private key. The ultimate decisions to (a) transact on the
        blockchain using your wallet address, as well as (b) share the public
        key relating to your wallet address with anyone (including us) rests
        with you. IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN
        ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY
        NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE
        TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE
        BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON
        THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.
      </p>
      Specifically, information regarding your digital wallet addresses
      (including transactions performed by said digital wallet addresses),
      public cryptographic key relating to digital wallet addresses on
      distributed ledger networks and/or similar information which you utilise
      to access the Website will be linked to your user account. By accessing
      our services, you provide your consent to our services reading and/or
      accessing information from such digital wallet addresses in order to
      verify ownership of any digital assets or tokens associated with such
      address (whether fungible or non-fungible). Users will have the ability to
      "add" their digital wallet address to access our services, as well as the
      ability to "remove" such stored wallets. All data obtained by us in
      connection with your digital wallet addresses shall be treated as personal
      data and dealt with in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy
      Policy.
      <h2>Purposes for collection, use and disclosure of your personal data</h2>

      may be sent to you in various modes including but not limited to
      electronic mail, direct mailers, short message service, telephone calls,
      facsimile and other mobile messaging services, and may be sent directly by

      respect of sending telemarketing messages to your telephone number via
      short message service, telephone calls, facsimile and other mobile
      messaging services, please be assured that we shall only do so if we have
      your clear and unambiguous consent in writing or other recorded form to do

      with you and you have not indicated to us that you do not wish to receive
      telemarketing messages sent to your telephone number, we may send you
      telemarketing messages to that number related to the subject of our
      ongoing relationship via short message service, facsimile and other mobile
      messaging services (other than a voice or video call). You may at any time
      request that we stop contacting you for marketing purposes via selected or

      disclosed to them are kept confidential and secure. For more information
      about the third parties with whom we share your personal data, you may,

      and services you have requested. To update your personal data, please
      contact us at the contact details provided below. Where you provide us
      with personal data concerning individuals other than yourself, you are
      responsible for obtaining all legally required consents from the concerned
      individuals and you shall retain proof of such consent(s), such proof to
      be provided to us upon our request. We may transfer, store, process and/or
      deal with your personal data in any jurisdiction, and accordingly such

      submission of such information represents your agreement to the transfer
      of personal data as described herein.
      <h2>Retention of personal data</h2>
      Your personal data is retained as long as the purpose for which it was

      business purposes. This enables us to comply with legal and regulatory
      requirements or use it where we need to for our legitimate purposes, such
      as transfers of digital assets, and dealing with any disputes or concerns
      that may arise. We may need to retain information for a longer period
      where we need the information to comply with regulatory or legal
      requirements or where we may need it for our legitimate purposes (e.g. to
      help us respond to queries or complaints, fighting fraud and financial
      crime, responding to requests from regulators etc). When we no longer need
      to use personal data, we will remove it from our systems and records

      from it.
